# Queries

A collection of database/API queries in GraphQL, SPARQL, SQL and dialects to retrieve data from sources such as Google BigQuery, StackOverflow, DBpedia and Wikidata.

I've used the resulting datasets in several projects, such as [programminglanguages.info](https://programminglanguages.info/), my [Jupyter notebooks](https://ramiro.org/notebooks/) and tools like the [Reddit Post Times Explorer](https://ramiro.org/tools/reddit-post-times/).
