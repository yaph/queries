# Queries

A collection of database/API queries in GraphQL, SPARQL, SQL and dialects to retrieve data from sources such as Google BigQuery, StackOverflow, DBpedia and Wikidata.

You can see the application of these queries and how to process and visualize the resulting data on [programminglanguages.info](https://programminglanguages.info/), in several od my [Jupyter notebooks](https://ramiro.org/notebooks/) and tools like the [Reddit Post Times Explorer](https://ramiro.org/tools/reddit-post-times/).
